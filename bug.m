In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    // ... some other code ...
}
@end
```

This seems straightforward; however, if `someMethod` is called multiple times, the `myString` property will retain a new string each time, preventing the old string from being released until `MyClass` itself is deallocated.  This can lead to memory leaks, especially within long-running applications or if `someMethod` is called frequently.

Another potential issue is related to delegate patterns. If a delegate is retained strongly, and the delegate object retains the object that set it, a retain cycle is created. This also leads to memory issues and prevents objects from being deallocated properly.  Consider this:

```objectivec
@interface MyDelegate : NSObject <MyProtocol> 
@end

@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) id <MyProtocol> delegate;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)setDelegate:(id<MyProtocol>)delegate {
    _delegate = delegate;
}
@end

@implementation MyDelegate
- (id)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
        myObject.delegate = self; //Retain Cycle if MyObject retain delegate
    }
    return self;
}
@end
```

This code creates a retain cycle: MyObject retains MyDelegate, and MyDelegate (implicitly or explicitly) retains MyObject (by using self inside its init method). Breaking such cycles requires careful use of `weak` properties or using `__unsafe_unretained` (with extreme caution).
